Troy Berg's PKI Battle Plan
======================

Part 1) Build the underlying infrastructure
===========================================

1) Deploy DC (best practices)
	- install AD DS
	- test and verify our DNS
	- deploy a subset of OUs, admin users
		(AD CS is deployed in part via GPO)

2) Deploy workstations 
	- Join the domain 
	- Test and verify

3) Deploy Enterprise CA
	- Join the domain

4) Deploy Root CA
	- NOT domain joined


Part 2) Build the PKI Hierarchy
===========================================

1) Deploy Root CA

	- Install AD CS (standalone CA)
	- Configure AD CS
		- Claim the root CA role (establish your trust anchor)
		- Pre-configure the certificate extensions (AIA and CDP/CRL information)

			AIA (Authority Information Access)
			e.g. http://10.10.10.10/certdata/<ServerDNSName><CaName><CertificateName>

			CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
			e.g. http://10.10.10.10/certdata/<CaName><CRLNameSuffix><DeltaCRLAllowed>.crl

			Default locations of CRL and Root Certificate
			C:\Windows\System32\CertServ\CertEnroll

		- Publish the CRL
		- Export Root Certificate with CA's public key
	- Export our Root CA, our CRL, and our CA's public key to Enterprise (issuing) CA

2) Deploy our Enterprise CA

	- Install the AD CS role
		- Claim the Enterprise CA role
	- Create the trust relationship (PKI hierarchy) with the Root CA
		- Create the EntCA public key
		- Install the Root certificate (with public key) on the EntCA
		- Extend AIA by creating certificate and CRL distribution point
		- Send a certificate request (with Enterprise public key) to the Root CA
		- Complete the certificate request process on the Ent CA
		- Export and install the new .pkb certificate granting issuing authority

Part 3) Distribute the Certificates via GPO
===========================================

3) Configure our Domain to Utilize the Enterprise CA

	- Populate the eventual IIS publication point for the AIA and CRL
		- e.g. http://www.troy.net/aia
		- e.g. http://www.troy.net/crl
	- Use user and computer templates to create domain certificates and modify key settings
		- Duplicate, modify and issue templates for users and domain computers
		- Key settings: Compatibility, General Naming, and Security
		- Remember special parameters for user settings
	- Create a GPO to autoenroll users and computers
		- Computer and Users > Policies > Windows Settings > Security > Public Key Policies > Certificate Enrolment Policy
		- Computer and Users > Policies > Windows Settings > Security > Public Key Policies > Auto-Enrolment Policy
	- Simultaneously allow the Root CA to be issued via GPO
		- Computer > Policies > Windows Settings > Security > Public Key Policies > Trusted Root Certification Authorities

Part 4) Test for Success
===========================================

4) Verify successful issuing of certificates for domain users and workstations
